# Custom Clock and Calendar System

## Abstract
This project details the design and implementation of a custom timekeeping system, developed as a unique alternative to the Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clock. It features a novel calendar structure with redefined day, month, and year units, along with a 24-hour timekeeping mechanism. This system is designed for use in applications requiring a distinct temporal framework.

## Keywords
custom calendar, timekeeping system, alternative calendar, 24-hour clock, ancient time.

## Introduction
The conventional Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clock are widely used standards for timekeeping across the globe. However, alternative systems may be desirable in certain scenarios, such as fictional world-building, artistic projects, or specific cultural contexts. This project presents a custom timekeeping system featuring a new calendar structure and a standard 24-hour clock.

## System Design
The custom timekeeping system comprises two main components: a 24-hour clock and a custom calendar.

### 24-Hour Clock
- The system employs a standard 24-hour clock.
- A day is divided into 24 hours.
- Each hour consists of 60 minutes, and each minute consists of 60 seconds.
- The time is displayed in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

### Custom Calendar
- **Day**: A day is referred to as a "dina." There are five days in a week:
  - dharma, bhima, arjuna, nakula, sahdeva.
- **Week**: A week consists of five "dina"s. and is called as saptaha
- **Month**: A month, referred to as a "maha," comprises three weeks.
- **Year**: A year, referred to as a "karna," is made up of seven months.
  - The months are named: Atri, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Jamadagni, Kashyapa, Vashistha, Vishvamitra.
- **Epoch Start**: The calendar starts from March 26, 2025, which is considered as day one.

## Implementation
This system is implemented using [mention language or framework if applicable]. The implementation accurately tracks and displays time according to the defined custom structure.

## System Evaluation
- Provides a functional alternative to the standard Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clock.
- Accurately represents time and date based on the custom structure.
- Can be integrated into various applications requiring a unique timekeeping system.

## Conclusion
This project presents a custom timekeeping system with a unique calendar structure and a 24-hour clock. While the Gregorian calendar and 24-hour clock serve as global standards, this system offers a creative alternative for specific applications.
